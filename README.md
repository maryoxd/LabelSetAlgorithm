# 🏷️ Label-Set Algorithm – Java Implementation  

This project implements the **Label-Set Algorithm** in **Java**, used for finding the **shortest path in a weighted graph**. The algorithm efficiently processes graph edges and dynamically updates the shortest path from a source to a destination vertex.

## 📌 Features  
- **Reads graph data from a file** – Automatically detects vertices and edges.  
- **Efficient pathfinding** – Computes the shortest path using **edge relaxation**.  
- **Adjacency list representation** – Stores graph edges dynamically for efficient traversal.  
- **Outputs final path and cost** – Displays the shortest route and total weight.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java (Standard Library & Collections API)**  
- **Graph Representation (Adjacency List)**  
- **File Handling (Input Processing)**  
- **Edge Relaxation for Shortest Path Calculation**
